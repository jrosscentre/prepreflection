the hardest thing I have learned is how to talk the language with the different embeddings of things and where things belong in phrasing of questions and working through things. In order to make progress in learning this subject, communication and usingthe same termonology in the right places is imperitive. that has been the hardest thing to work through, but it is also the most beneficial thing that has heped me in the past couple of labs. I have been able to ask good questions and learn more from the labs.

The thing I still don tunderstand is how to link a set of data to another set of data through a function. To re phrase for slarification, I have trouble taking a set of data and by clicking or whatever the operation may be, a peice of another set of data will appear in the corresponding spots.
